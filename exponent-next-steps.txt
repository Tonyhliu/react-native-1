Next steps:
------------
1. Find your AppRegistry.registerComponent('YourApplicationName', () => YourRootComponent) call and replace it with Exponent.registerRootComponent(YourRootComponent) (you will need to import Exponent from 'exponent').
2. Upload your app icon somewhere on the web and add it the newly created exp.json file, in the iconUrl and loading.iconUrl fields.
3. Delete your 'android' and 'ios' directories if you have them -- you no longer need to compile any native code to run your app.
4. Resolve any issues with potentially incompatible packages: 

** react-native-vector-icons: We installed @exponent/vector-icons for you instead. When you feel like it, you can change any use of react-native-vector-icons to this. But no rush, we also installed our fork of react-native-vector-icons that uses @exponent/vector-icons behind the scenes, so you don't actually *need* to make any changes.
When you want to convert it, you'll just need to do something like this: "import Icon from 'react-native-vector-icons/Ionicons'" becomes "import { Ionicons as Icon } from '@exponent/vector-icons'" 
** This may not be an exhaustive list of packages you will need to address -- any package that has a native code dependency will need to be converted to an Exponent equivalent or removed. Refer to the SDK API reference here: https://docs.getexponent.com/versions/latest/sdk/index.html
5. Open your app in XDE and run it, fix bugs as they arise.
